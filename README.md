MiniMessenger is a simple yet powerful MiniMessage wrapper that fetches tags dynamically from a MongoDB configuration

# WARNING
To keep the project build file small, MiniMessenger does not bundle with a MongoDB driver.
You will need to add "org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:VERSION later than 4.9.0" to your final jar.
